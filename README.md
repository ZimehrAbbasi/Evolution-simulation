# Evolution-simulation

Simulation of a genetic algorithm written using the P5 library. Targets can be placed on the canvas, and the organisms will follow the targets along a path. This program uses a genetic algorithm to find the path from the first target to the last in the chain.

Link to the simulation can be found [here.](https://zimehrabbasi.github.io/Evolution-simulation/)
